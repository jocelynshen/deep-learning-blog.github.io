Whilst selecting the in-game score the player earned as a reflection of the informal goal of finishing the race is a reasonable reward function, it allows for dangerous and harmful behavior, as visible in the video above. The agent can drive off the track, crash into other boats, and catch fire and still win the game whilst achieving a score on average 20 percent higher than that achieved by human players.</p> <p>How can we prevent the agents from violating safety constraints (e.g., crashing into other boats)?

This action is executed in an environment resulting in a new state and a reward that evaluates the action. Given the new state, the feedback loop repeats. </div> <p>In Reinforcement Learning, the world is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the goal is to select a policy \(\pi\) which maximizes an expected cumulative reward \(J^π\).</p> <p>\(J^π\) can be taken to be the infinite horizon discounted total return as</p> \[J^\pi = \mathbb{E}_{s\sim\mu} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t) \right]\] <p>where \(\gamma\) is the discount factor, and \(r(s_t,a_t)\) is the reward function.</p> <p>However, the agents must obey safety constraints in many real-world applications while achieving the goal. We can introduce a constraint objective analogous to the reward objective. This objective is typically defined as the expected constraint value over N time steps \(J^π_C = \mathbb{E}_{s\sim\mu} \left[ C(s) \right]\). The method of aggregating individual constraints over time can vary, e.g., using the average or the maximum constraint value over N time steps or even a discounted sum.</p> <p>In the example of the robot, the aim could be to prolong the motor life of the various robots while still enabling them to perform the task at hand. Thus we constrain the robot motors from using high torque values. Here, constraint C is defined as the average torque the agent has applied to each motor, and the penalty \(c(s, a)\) becomes the average amount of torque the agent decided to use at each time step.</p> <p>We limit the allowable amount of torque applied to \(\alpha\). <br> The constrained MDP for our safe reinforcement learning problem is:</p> \[\max_{\pi \in \Pi} J^\pi_R \text{ s.t. } J^\pi_C \leq \alpha\] <h1 id="constrained-policy-optimization">Constrained Policy Optimization</h1> <p>Constrained objectives are often solved using the Lagrange relaxation technique. With parameterized approaches such as Neural Networks, the objective is then to find the networks parameters \(\theta\) that maximize \(J^\pi_R\) subject to the constraint \(J^\pi_C \leq \alpha\) given the Lagrangian multiplier \(\lambda\):</p> \[\min_{\lambda}\max_{\theta} [J^{\pi_\theta}_R - \lambda (J^{\pi_\theta}_C - \alpha)]\] <p>We now have our new global objective function that is subject to optimization!</p> <h3 id="what-exactly-does-the-lagrangian-do">What exactly does the Lagrangian do?</h3> <p>Intuitively, the Lagrangian multiplier \(\lambda\) determines how much weight is put onto the constraint. If \(\lambda\) is set to 0, the constraint is ignored, and the objective becomes the reward objective \(J^\pi_R\). If \(\lambda\) is set very high, the constraint is enforced very strictly, and the global objective function reduces to the constraint objective \(J^π_C\). Let’s look at a simple example to <strong>demonstrate the effect of the Lagrangian multiplier \(\lambda\)</strong>. We’ll use the simple CartPole Gym environment. The reward in this environment is +1 for every step the pole was kept upright.</p> <p>We can now add an example constraint to the environment. Let’s say we want to keep the cart in the left quarter of the x-axis. We, therefore, define the constraint value as the x-position of the cart and the upper bound \(\alpha\) as -2.</p> <p>Let’s see how with different lambda values, the constraint is enforced.</p> <center> <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" controls="" src="https://jocelynshen.com/deep-learning-blog.github.io/assets/video/2023-01-31-Adaptive-Reward-Penalty-in-Safe-Reinforcement-Learning/cart_pole_lambda.mp4" style="width:500px" type="video/mp4"> </video> <figcaption> The green area represents the "safe zone", where the x-position is smaller than -2, and the red area is the "unsafe zone". <br> The lower the lambda, the more the constraint is ignored. The higher the lambda, the more the constraint is enforced, and the main reward objective is ignored. At λ = 1,000,000 the cart shoots to the right to tilt the pole to the left but does so ignoring the following balancing act, which is observable at λ ∈ {10, 100}.</figcaption> </center> <p>Tuning the \(\lambda\) through <a href="https://gibberblot.github.io/rl-notes/single-agent/reward-shaping.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reward shaping</a> is no easy feat. The Lagrangian is a scaling factor, i.e., if the constraint values are inherently larger than the reward values, we will need a substantially lower \(\lambda\) than when the constraint values are significantly smaller than the possible reward values. That means that the range of good lambda values is large and differs with every environment.</p> <h3 id="how-can-we-learn-an-optimal-lagrangian">How can we learn an optimal Lagrangian?</h3> <p>Luckily, it is possible to <strong>view the Lagrangian as a learnable parameter</strong> and update it through gradient descent since the globally constrained optimization objective \(J^{\pi_{\theta}}\) is differentiable. In short, we can simply use the derivative of the objective function w.r.t \(\lambda\) and update the Lagrangian.</p> \[\frac{\partial J^{\pi_{\theta}}}{\partial \lambda} = -(J^{\pi_{\theta}}_C - \alpha)\] \[\lambda \gets max(\lambda - lr_{\lambda}(-(\mathbb{E}^{\pi_\theta}_{s\sim\mu} \left[C\right] - \alpha)), 0)\] <p>Hereby \(lr_{\lambda}\) is the learning rate for the Lagrangian multiplier. The max function ensures that the Lagrangian multiplier is always positive.</p> <h1 id="reward-constrained-policy-optimization">Reward Constrained Policy Optimization</h1> <p>Actor-Critic based approaches such as <a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ppo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPO</a> <d-cite key="Schulman2017PPO"></d-cite> have empirically been shown to compete at the top of a plethora of quality benchmarks. In this class of algorithms, the actor learns a policy \(\pi\), whereas the critic learns the value function using temporal difference learning.

They limit the amount of torque the agent is allowed to apply, hinder the exploration of unsafe and poor-performing local minima and guide the policy to a safe and more optimal solution. <br> Nevertheless, the poor performance of the unconstrained agents may be due to the neural network architecture being relatively small (i.e., 2 layers of 64 hidden units).</p> <h3 id="qualitative-observations">Qualitative observations</h3> <p>Finally ,let’s see how our HalfCheetah agents walk under the To do so, we have recorded videos of the agents walking forward with different \(\lambda\) values.

With λ ∈ {0, 0.00001} the robot can walk forward, but it is visible that it moves its legs much quicker and more aggressively than the RCPPO agent. Furthermore, the RCPPO agent walks perfectly, whilst the other (moving) agents tumble over their own hecktick steps.</p> <h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1> <h3 id="theoretical-assumptions-vs-empirical-results">Theoretical assumptions vs. empirical results</h3> <p>We had to select higher values for the Lagrangian multiplier than what were used in the original paper. In the paper, a \(\lambda\) value of 0.1 is already very high as it leads to a reward of \(-0.4\) and torque of \(0.1387\), whereas in our case a \(\lambda\) value of \(1.0\) leads to a reward of about \(1 500\) with an average torque of \(0.39\). <br> This affected the reward shaping process but also meant we had to increase the Lagrangian’s respective learning rate when training it as a parameter to grow quicker. As a result, \(lr_{\lambda}\) becomes larger than \(lr_{\pi}\), which <strong>ignores one of the assumptions made in the paper</strong>, yet leads to coherent results.</p> <p>A possible reason for the slower and weaker impact of the constraint could be attributed to the clipping of the trust region. This technique ensures that the policy does not change too much between updates and prevents it from landing in a bad local minimum that it can not escape. This is done by clipping the policy update to a specific range. Therefore, even with “high” values of lambda w.r.t. the original paper, the policy will not change significantly to conform to the constraint.</p> <p>Not only did we have to select a higher learning rate for the Lagrangian, but we also did not include different learning rates for the policy and the value function, <strong>ignoring the three times scales approach</strong> proposed in the original paper. Additionally, in the original paper the RCPPO algorithm updated their networks (actor and critic) after each episode. In our implementation, we need to fill the rollout buffer with potentially multiple episodes, thus reducing the frequency of network parameters and Lagrangian updates. Nevertheless, the PPO algorithm implements a parameter update loop of n epochs after each rollout, which to a degree counteracts the discussed lower update frequency of all parameters.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>The results of the experiments show that the RCPO approach can learn a policy that can optimize the main reward objective while respecting the constraint.</p> <p>Safe Reinforcement Learning is a critical area of research in the field of artificial intelligence, as it has the potential to shape the future of autonomous systems in a multitude of domains, ranging from robotics to finance. <br> The more complex systems become, the more difficult it is to ensure safety requirements, especially through simple reward shaping. An approach such as RCPO can ensure that the safety constraints are respected while enforcing them by only providing the constraint itself.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/deep-learning-blog.github.io/assets/bibliography/2023-01-31-Adaptive-Reward-Penalty-in-Safe-Reinforcement-Learning.bib"></d-bibliography> <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="iclr-blogposts/2023" issue-term="pathname" theme="github-light" crossorigin="anonymous" async> </script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
